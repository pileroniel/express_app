###Steps taken in building app
Without using express generator, we first npm init this
project and install express and nodemon

npm install express nodemon

Nodemon- a tool to automatically restart our server when a change is made to your project. We don't have to stop and start our server everytime a change is made to our program

We install babel javascript compiler dev dependencies to ensure our project will be compatible with ES6

--save-dev is used when installing dev dependecies

npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli

Four packages used from babel here are core, node, preset-env, cli

Create cogif file for babel to indicate the presets we have installed
touch .babelrc 

In our package.json file we add "type":"module" to enable modules to be used in your project

In the scripts section we configure how our start script works. 
"start":"nodemon --experimental-json-modules --exec babel-node index.js"
The flag --experimental-json-modules allows us to run the script using a json module(since we changed the type element above to type module)
The last three commands tell the program to run at entry point index js, using the node package from babel
